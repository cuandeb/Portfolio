# Astronomy

This is a portion of the code used for my final year astronomy project. The project involved using images 
collected by the class at the Calar Alto observatory in Spain to analysis celestial objects. 

My project was to study three variable stars called Cepheids that vary in luminosity over time. The aim of
the study was to construct a light curve to display the variable nature of the star. This notebook details
the initial analysis of the first of the three stars. This includes locating it in the sky, calibrating the
image flux to real flux and plotting the variation in luminosity

**IMPORTANT:** This is not neat code! This was the first big project I undertook that required a lot of 
coding experience. I had not become accustomed to proper coding ettiquite like proper commenting and formatting. 
Therefore the code is messy and it may be difficult to follow. I have mainly included it because it makes
use of astronomical packages such as *astropy* and *photutils*. Although messy, the code does contain some 
nice examples of 3d plotting, and astrometry. 

The code and analysis returned good results and overall I received an A grade for the project. However as mentioned
above this is an example of my early coding and more recent projects are far more developed both in neatness and format
but also programming style.
